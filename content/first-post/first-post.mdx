title: First Blog Post!
---

This is a blog post that leverages the `mdx-bundler` `cwd` and the image bundling approach 
suggested [here](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler#image-bundling) to create an easy 
to grok source for this Next.js site. You can co-locate file-based assets with your `mdx` files
creating "bundles" of source material. A bonus feature here as well is that the local, 
relative path is also understood by github, so you get image previews in the GitHub 
rendered markdown, regardless of where this bundle is in the file system.

![A kitten](./kitten.jpg)

The image above is in the same folder, next to this file. The process to accomplish this is
as follows:

1. When the `mdx` file is sourced, the file path is provided to the `mdx-bundler` config: `content/first-post/first-post.mdx`
2. The directory is parsed from the file path, and set as the `cwd` for `mdx-bundler`. `content/first-post`
3. The path to `kitten.jpg` which needs to be bundled, is now understood to be `content/first-post/kitten.jpg`
4. `kitten.jpg` is copied to the Next.js public folder by `mdx-bundler`.
5. Finally, thanks to `mdx-bundler` the URL in the compiled `first-post` body is updated to the bundled, public path, `public/images/first-post/kitten.jpg`.
