title: First Blog Post!
---

This is a blog post that leverages the `mdx-bundler` `cwd` and the image bundling approach 
suggested [here](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler#image-bundling) to create an easy 
to grok source for this Next.js site.

![A kitten](./kitten.jpg)

The image above is in the same folder, next to this file. The process to accomplish this is
as follows:

1. When the `mdx` file is sourced, the file path is provided to the `mdx-bundler` config. `content/first-post/first-post.mdx`
2. The directory is parsed from the file path, and set as the `cwd` for `mdx-bundler`. `content/first-post`
3. The path to `kitten.png` which needs to be bundled, is now understood to be `content/first-post/kitten.jpg`
4. `kitten.png` is copied to the Next.js public folder by `mdx-bundler`.
5. Finally, thanks to `mdx-bundler` the URL in the compiled `first-post` body is updated to the bundled, public path, `public/images/first-post/kitten.jpg`.
